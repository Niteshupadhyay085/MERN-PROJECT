🌐 How the Website Works

User Signup/Login:- 
A new user can register using the signup page.
Existing users can log in with their email and password.
After login, users receive a secure JWT token for accessing protected routes.

Dashboard / Main Page :-
Once logged in, users can view and manage data (based on your project — e.g., workouts, tasks, servers, etc.).
The data is fetched from the backend API and displayed dynamically.

CRUD Operations:-
Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete their entries.
All operations are connected to MongoDB in real-time.

Authentication:-
Protected routes ensure that only logged-in users can access certain pages.
JWT tokens are verified in each API request.

Responsive UI:-
The frontend is built with React and adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
